## Narative

Computer Science students (or students taking computer science courses) who would like addition practice, are limited by the availablity of the computer science tutors.  To provide students additional resources for practice and review independant of tutor availability, this project will create a slack bot to ask questions and review code snippets.  This functionality will be handeled with a python3 program running in the cloud.
